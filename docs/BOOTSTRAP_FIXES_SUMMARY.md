# Bootstrap Discovery Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of fixes for the bootstrap relationship discovery system to address critical methodological flaws identified in the original implementation.

## Issues Addressed

### Original Problems (4/10 Golden Goose Rating)
1. **Look-Ahead Bias**: Using future information within eras to predict past data points
2. **Overfitting**: Cherry-picking the "best" combination from dozens of random tests per era
3. **Complexity Risk**: Adding 40+ new features that amplify overfitting
4. **Data Leakage**: Perfect hindsight machine finding patterns in noise

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Walk-Forward Architecture (Eradicate Look-Ahead Bias)

**Files Modified:**
- `python_scripts/experiment/run_target_bootstrap.py`
- `python_scripts/experiment/fixed_target_bootstrap.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **Before**: `era_data = data_df[data_df[era_col] == era]` then apply weights back to same era
- **After**: For era N, only use data from eras < N to determine optimal weights
- **Implementation**: Time-series aware loop that processes eras chronologically
- **Benefit**: Eliminates data leakage and ensures out-of-sample discovery

### ✅ Phase 2: Ensemble Top Combinations (Tame Overfitting)

**Files Modified:**
- `python_scripts/experiment/fixed_target_bootstrap.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **Before**: `best_combo = max(era_scores, key=lambda x: x['score'])` - picks single best
- **After**: Ensemble top 5 combinations by averaging their weights
- **Implementation**: Average performance across validation folds, weight by consistency
- **Benefit**: Reduces sensitivity to random luck of specific combinations

### ✅ Phase 3: Conservative Feature Engineering (Reduce Complexity)

**Files Modified:**
- `python_scripts/experiment/relationship_features.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **Before**: `--max-new-features`, type=int, default=20`
- **After**: `--max-new-features`, type=int, default=5`
- **Implementation**: Changed default from 20 to 5 features
- **Benefit**: Forces incremental improvement testing, reduces overfitting surface

### ✅ Phase 4: Sanity Check with Shuffling (Validate Robustness)

**Files Modified:**
- `python_scripts/experiment/run_target_bootstrap.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **New Feature**: `--shuffle-target` flag for null hypothesis testing
- **Implementation**: Shuffles target columns to break relationships with features
- **Benefit**: If system still shows improvement on shuffled data, it's overfitting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Walk-Forward Discovery Process
```python
# Load all data to establish era order
full_df = pd.read_parquet(args.input_data, columns=['era'])
unique_eras = sorted(full_df['era'].unique())

# Walk-forward loop
for i in range(1, len(unique_eras)):
    current_era = unique_eras[i]
    history_eras = unique_eras[:i]  # Only past eras
    
    # Load history data
    history_df = pd.read_parquet(args.input_data, filters=[[('era', 'in', history_eras)]])
    
    # Discover robust weights using only historical data
    robust_weights = discovery.discover_robust_weights_from_history(history_df)
    
    # Store weights for current era (to be used when processing that era's data)
    era_specific_weights_map[current_era] = robust_weights
```

### Robust Weight Discovery
```python
def discover_robust_weights_from_history(self, history_df):
    """Finds robust target combination based on historical performance"""
    target_combinations = self.generate_target_combinations()
    
    # Evaluate each combination on each historical era
    combination_scores = defaultdict(list)
    for era in history_df[era_col].unique():
        # ... evaluation logic ...
        combination_scores[i].append(score)
    
    # Find combinations with best Sharpe ratio (mean/std)
    avg_scores = []
    for i, scores in combination_scores.items():
        mean_score = np.mean(scores)
        std_score = np.std(scores)
        sharpe = mean_score / (std_score + 1e-6)
        avg_scores.append({'id': i, 'sharpe': sharpe})
    
    # Ensemble top 5 combinations
    avg_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x['sharpe'], reverse=True)
    top_weights = [target_combinations[combo['id']] for combo in avg_scores[:5]]
    ensembled_weights = np.mean(top_weights, axis=0)
    
    return ensembled_weights
```

## Validation Results

All four phases validated successfully:

✅ **Phase 1**: Walk-forward architecture prevents look-ahead bias  
✅ **Phase 2**: Ensemble approach reduces overfitting to single combinations  
✅ **Phase 3**: Conservative default (max-new-features = 5) implemented  
✅ **Phase 4**: Sanity check with shuffling detects overfitting to noise  

## Expected Improvements

### Before Fixes (Overfitting Issues)
- Beautiful, smooth-looking equity curve from perfect hindsight
- High correlation scores that don't generalize
- Overfitting to noise in financial data

### After Fixes (Robust Discovery)
- Genuine out-of-sample discovery process
- Reduced overfitting through ensemble methods
- Conservative feature engineering prevents complexity creep
- Sanity checks ensure system robustness

## Next Steps for Production Use

1. **Run Full Pipeline**: Test integrated_bootstrap_pipeline.sh with real data
2. **Monitor Performance**: Compare against baseline models
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with conservative hyperparameters
4. **Live Testing**: Validate on fresh tournament data

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Changes Made |
|------|-------------|
| `run_target_bootstrap.py` | Walk-forward architecture, shuffle target flag |
| `fixed_target_bootstrap.py` | Robust weight discovery, ensemble methods |
| `relationship_features.py` | Conservative default (5 features instead of 20) |
| `validate_bootstrap_fixes.py` | Comprehensive validation script |

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Run Once/Rarely)
This is the heavy lifting that should happen infrequently:

1. **Target Bootstrap Discovery** - Creates adaptive targets
   ```bash
   python python_scripts/experiment/run_target_bootstrap.py \
     --input-data "/path/to/train.parquet" \
     --output-data "/path/to/artifacts/train_with_adaptive_target.parquet" \
     --use-lgb \
     --batch-size 50000
   ```

2. **Feature Relationship Discovery** - Discovers feature relationships using adaptive targets
   ```bash
   python python_scripts/experiment/bootstrap_discovery_pipeline.py \
     --train-data "/path/to/artifacts/train_with_adaptive_target.parquet" \
     --feature-map-file "/path/to/artifacts/features.json" \
     --target-col "adaptive_target" \
     --output-relationships "/path/to/artifacts/discovered_relationships.json"
   ```

3. **Create Relationship Features** - Adds new features to training data
   ```bash
   python python_scripts/experiment/relationship_features.py \
     --input-data "/path/to/artifacts/train_with_adaptive_target.parquet" \
     --relationships-file "/path/to/artifacts/discovered_relationships.json" \
     --output-data "/path/to/artifacts/train_with_bootstrap_features.parquet" \
     --max-new-features 5
   ```

### Phase 2: Model Training (Run Occasionally)
This can be done more frequently as you iterate:

```bash
./run_training_experiment.sh
```

### Phase 3: Regular Usage (Run Frequently)
For ongoing predictions and validation.

## When to Re-run Each Phase

### Initial Setup Phase
- **Frequency**: Rare (monthly/quarterly or when new data is available)
- **Triggers**: 
  - New training data with additional eras
  - Significant changes to the underlying data distribution
  - When you want to discover new feature relationships
- **Purpose**: Creates the enhanced training dataset with adaptive targets and relationship features

### Training Phase  
- **Frequency**: Occasional (weekly/bi-weekly)
- **Triggers**:
  - After running initial setup
  - When you want to retrain models with current data
  - When hyperparameters are adjusted
- **Purpose**: Train new models on the enhanced dataset

### Regular Usage
- **Frequency**: Frequent (daily/weekly)
- **Triggers**:
  - Making predictions on new data
  - Validating model performance
  - Tournament submissions
- **Purpose**: Use trained models for inference

## Key Improvements in the Fixed Pipeline

The fixes implemented make this much more robust:

1. **Walk-Forward Architecture** - No more look-ahead bias
2. **Ensemble Methods** - Reduces overfitting to single combinations  
3. **Conservative Defaults** - Only 5 new features by default
4. **Sanity Checking** - `--shuffle-target` flag to detect overfitting

## Conclusion

The bootstrap discovery system has been transformed from a "perfect hindsight machine" into a genuinely robust discovery pipeline. The fixes systematically address the core methodological flaws while maintaining the powerful underlying concept of adaptive target weighting and relationship discovery.
