Oh, I'm absolutely picking up what you're putting down. Your UI is currently the digital equivalent of a vending machine that only dispenses disappointment and command-line strings. Let me translate your righteous indignation into something an LLM can actually sink its teeth into:

**PROMPT: Transform Target Discovery UI from "Meh" to "Hell Yeah"**

I need to dramatically improve the web UI for the target discovery pipeline step (`step_01_target_discovery.py`). Currently it's a glorified command generator that tells users nothing useful. I want it to become an intelligent, informative interface that actually helps users understand what they're doing.

**Current Problem:** The UI is a basic form that collects parameters and spits out a command. Users have no idea what their choices mean, how long things will take, what's happening during execution, or whether their results are any good.

**Progress Checklist:**

- [x] 1. Smart Parameter Explanation Panel — implemented in web wizard as a side panel with explanations, trade-offs, recommended values, and runtime impact.
- [x] 2. Pre-Flight Validation & Estimation — implemented: backend /preflight endpoint with file validation, parquet metadata extraction, runtime/memory/disk estimates, and frontend Preflight panel in the wizard.
- [x] 2.a Emit merged features.json per run — pipeline now writes a run-local features.json (baseline medium + engineered names) after Stage 3 and records it in run_summary for reuse.
- [ ] 3. Live Progress Dashboard — pending
- [ ] 4. Results Intelligence Panel — pending
- [ ] 5. Historical Results Browser — pending
- [ ] 6. Additional Analysis Integration — pending

**What I Want Built:**

1. **Smart Parameter Explanation Panel**
   - For each option (skip_walk_forward, max_eras, target_limit, etc.), show:
     - Plain English explanation of what it does
   - Performance/accuracy trade-offs
     - Recommended values for different scenarios
     - Impact on runtime (e.g., "This will take ~45 minutes instead of 3 hours")

2. **Pre-Flight Validation & Estimation**
   - Check if input files exist and are valid
   - Estimate runtime based on parameters and data size
   - Warning system for potentially problematic combinations
   - Resource requirements (memory, disk space)

3. **Live Progress Dashboard** (while running)
   - Current era being processed (e.g., "Processing era 127/340")
   - Real-time metrics from the discovery process
   - Estimated time remaining
   - Key statistics as they're computed (Sharpe ratios, sign consistency, etc.)

4. **Results Intelligence Panel** (when complete)
   - **Quick Quality Assessment**: Visual indicators of whether results look good
   - **Target Weight Heatmap**: Show which targets got emphasized when
   - **Performance Metrics Summary**: Sharpe ratios, consistency scores, effective targets
   - **Stability Analysis**: How much weights drift over time
   - **Comparison Tools**: Compare against previous runs at a glance

5. **Historical Results Browser**
   - When selecting previous experiments, show their key results
   - Make it obvious which past runs produced good target combinations
   - One-click comparison between different discovery runs

6. **Additional Analysis Integration**
   - Surface relevant Python analysis scripts that can dive deeper into results
   - One-click execution of follow-up analysis
   - Export results in formats useful for further investigation

**Key UI Principles:**

- **Scannable**: Users should know if results are good within 5 seconds
- **Educational**: New users learn what good target discovery looks like
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps based on results quality
- **Comparative**: Easy to see how current results stack against previous attempts

**Technical Context:**
The target discovery uses walk-forward optimization to find era-specific target weight combinations. It tracks metrics like Sharpe ratios scaled by sign consistency, effective target counts, and weight drift. The UI should surface these concepts without requiring users to understand the underlying math.

Make this feel like a professional ML platform, not a homework assignment that got shipped to production.
